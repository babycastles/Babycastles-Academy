### Description

In this workshop we are going to talk about EMAIL! Yes, email! Not to complain about email (necessarily), but the good parts about email like the cool stuff that we can do with it: maintain a git repo, display html, run your own email server, use a CLI inbox, and make art. Good ol email only relies on a protocol from the 70s and it’s not going anywhere. For many of us it is the most used form of digital communication that doesn’t necessarily need to rely on big tech companies.We will converse about the future of email, our personal pasts of email, we can vent about email etiquette we can even read email’s natal chart if that’s where the conversation leads us.
Then in the second part of the workshop we will explore with toy email addresses that everyone will get an alternate email universe, where the emails we send are altered by a mischievous email server.
