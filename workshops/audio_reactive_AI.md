## Description

Videos are so much cooler when they're synced up to music! And if you really wanna blow some minds you can use AI to generate the source video! ðŸ¤¯

In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to make AI-generated videos in [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com), and also how to bring them into [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) to make them audio-reactive.

At the end of this workshop, you'll have:

- made your own AI-generated video that is synced up to a music track of your choice.
- learned how to build your own beat detector from scratch in TouchDesigner. This way, you can sync up any video to any audio track.
- learned a bit of machine learning in RunwayML along the way.
